Whatever happens in life, the Git commit should never be missed 😂 So, let’s understand the difference between 𝗚𝗶𝘁 𝘃𝘀 𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯.

In the development world, “Git” and “GitHub” are often mentioned together, but they’re not the same thing. Understanding the difference is key to mastering version control and effective collaboration.

Here's a quick breakdown:

𝗚𝗶𝘁:

A distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code.

Operates locally on your machine, giving you full control over your code history.

Enables branching, merging, and reverting to previous versions, making it easier to experiment and develop features independently.

𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯:

A web-based platform built on top of Git, designed to facilitate collaboration.

Hosts your Git repositories online, making them accessible from anywhere.

Offers tools like pull requests, issues, and project management boards to streamline teamwork, code reviews, and project tracking.
